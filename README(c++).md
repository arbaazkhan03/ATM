I worked on an enterprise level application  by using C++,which is popular,versatile,flexible and
for the security  the application & make it fast.
It is used to transfer funds,deposit cash and other features without interacting with bank staff.
User get the authority to use it with valid card number and pin code.
This application has a good user interface.
Since majority of the ATMs are on outdated Operating systems like windows 2000 etc,So i used
updated OS to check flaws like ransomware attacks, for securrity i write function with string argumentsin their format strings,
i took shorten input string for this.
